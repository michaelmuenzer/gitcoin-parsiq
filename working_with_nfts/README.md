## Purpose
Understand which Cryptokitties are traded most frequently. This can act as a starting point to better understand what properties are valuable to project enthusiasts at various price points.

We are using ParsiQL and it's Google sheets export to build a statistic over a longer time period. To gain these insights in realtime, we are monitoring the ERC-721 Token Transfers contract.

## Result
